Artist : Black SabbathTitle : Spiral ArchitectSorcerers of madness selling me their time
Child of God sitting in the sun giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction on a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman even fathers cry
Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see my world and know that it is good 
You know that I should 
Superstitious century, didn't time go slow?
Separating sanity watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker, spiral sky
Silver ships on plasmic oceans in disguise
Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth and know that they are good
You know that I should
Watching eyes of celluloid tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor replay give, give, give
Laughter kissing, love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect, I build, you pay
Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my Earth and feel the warmth and know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I shouldCredits
