Artist : AnathemaTitle : Flying (Remastered)Started a search to no avail
A light that shines behind the veil, trying to find it
And all around us everywhere
Is all that we could ever share if only we could see it
Feel there's truth that's beyond me
Life ever changing weaving destiny
And it feels like I'm flying above you
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
Seems like your trying to bring me down
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Layers of dust and yesterdays
Shadows fading in the haze of what I couldn't say
And though I said my hands were tied
Times have changed and now I find I'm free for the first time
Feel so close to everything now
Strange how life makes sense in time now
And it feels like I'm flying above you
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
Seems like your trying to bring me down
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back downExternal links
