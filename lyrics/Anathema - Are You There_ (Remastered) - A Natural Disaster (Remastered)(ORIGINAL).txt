Artist : AnathemaTitle : Are You There? (Remastered)Are you there?
Is it wonderful to know
All the ghosts, all the ghosts
Freak my selfish out, my mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
I know you'd do no harm to me
But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
Oh I wish you could see the love in her eyes
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
But what can I say now?
It couldn't be more wrong
'Cause there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Have we lost all the love that we could share?
And it's wearing me down
And it's turning me round
And I can't find a way now to find it out
Where are you when I need you
Are you there?
Are you there?
Are you thereExternal links
