He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
We are gonna miss him
We are gonna miss him
Yeah, so long
We wish you well
Told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well, so long
Don't cry
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried
Standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
We are gonna miss him
We are gonna miss him
There's no way
To recall
What it was that you had said to me
Like I care at all
But it was so loud
You sure could yell
Took a stand on every little thing
And so loud
You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
I was so sure I'd sin and you'd fall down too
"I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone and the symbol on you.
So he bashes his skull through the window while over looking the sea.
Twilight amber ego.
We were amused by this"
Yeah, standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so
Eager to identify
With someone above the ground
Someone who seemed to feel the same
Someone prepared to lead the way and
Someone who would die for me
Will you?
Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin' lie
Don't you step outta line
Don't you step outta line
Don't you step outta line
Don't you fuckin' lie
You've claimed all this time
That you would die for me
Why then are you so surprised
When you hear your own eulogy?
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
Come down
Get off your fuckin' cross
We need the fuckin' space
To nail the next fool martyr
To ascend, you must die
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies
GoodbyeCredits
