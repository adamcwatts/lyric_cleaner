# Python script for parsing and cleaning lyric files downloaded from Foobar Music player using the Lyric Show 3 addon
# 
### Clean_lyric_driver.py is currently set up using local path for where my lyrics are automatically downloaded, e.g., 'C:\Users\adamc\foobar_lyrics'
### Currently only works for text files .txt and not .lyrc files that are synced with time

txt.lyrics.py can be run locally using the test case lyrics included in the folder or imported as a module for the main driver to run at a specific location
